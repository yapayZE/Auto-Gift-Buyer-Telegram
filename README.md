Welcome to the **Auto-Gift-Buyer-Telegram** repository. This project features a Telegram User Bot designed for the automatic purchase of gifts. The bot is reliable and efficient, ensuring that you can buy gifts without hassle.

## üì¶ Features

- **Installation Support**: We provide step-by-step guidance to help you set up the User Bot.
- **Full Maintenance and Assistance**: Our team is available to support you throughout your experience with the bot.

## ‚ùì Why Choose a User Bot?

Many users wonder why they should opt for a User Bot instead of a regular bot. The answer lies in reliability. The official Telegram Bot API has faced issues in the past, causing regular bots to fail during crucial transactions. In contrast, the User Bot has proven to successfully complete all purchases. This makes it a more dependable choice, especially in critical situations.
